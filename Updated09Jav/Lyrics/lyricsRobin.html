Yah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you

See our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you

Yah, our hands will get more wrinkled
And our hair will be grey
Don't think I could forgive you

And see the children are starving
And their houses were destroyed
Don't think they could forgive you

Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when men will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you

Yah when there'll just be silence
And when life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you

Nothing's ever what we expect
But they keep asking where we're going next
All we're chasing is the sunset
Got my mind on you

Doesn't matter where we are are are are 
Doesn't matter where we are are are ar-are
Doesn't matter no
If there's a moment when it's perfect
We'll carve our names 

As the sun goes down
Hey
As the sun goes down
Hey
As the sun goes down

As the sun goes down
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are ar-are
Doesn't matter now

You are so lonely now [x2]

Why are you keeping me at a distance?
All that I'm asking for is forgiveness
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?
I keep on staring up at the ceiling
Waiting for you to give me some kind of reason
Are you even listening? Am I talking to myself again?

And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you

Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so

Why when I call, you never answer?
I'll try to talk, you keep on dancing
I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?

And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you

Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
If you love me, say something
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so

Shed a light, shed a light on me
Shed a light, shed a light on me
Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
