<div class="panel">
  <pre>
This time we almost made the pieces fit, didn't we?
This time we almost some sense of it, didn't we?
This time I have the answer right here in my hand,
Then I touched it, and it has turned to sand.
This time we almost sang the song in tune, didn't we?
This time we almost made it to the moon, didn't we?
This time, we almost made (almost made) a poem rhyme
And this time we almost made that long hard climb.
Didn't we almost make it this time... this time.

<button class="accordion">Watch What Happens</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
Let someone start believing in you, let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens
One someone who can look in your eyes, and see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens
Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you, and what magic you'll see
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you. and what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me
Let someone give his heart who cares like me

<button class="accordion">My Way</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way

[instrumental]

Yes, it was my way

<button class="accordion">If You Go Away</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
If you go away on this summer day,
Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky,
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long,
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song.
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again;
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain,
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind.
Then if you go, I'll understand,
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you,
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again.
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch,
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much.
But if you go, go, I won't cry,
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
If you go away, as I know you must,
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust,
Just an empty room, full of empty space,
Like the empty look I see on your face.
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side.
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.

<button class="accordion">Hallelujah, I Love Her So</button>
<div class="panel">
  <pre>
Let me tell 'bout a gal I know,
She's my baby and she lives next door.
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up,
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
When I'm in trouble and I got no friend,
I know she'll go with me down to the end.
Everybody asks me how do I know,
I smile a damn and say she told me so.
That why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
Now if I call her on the telephone,
Tell her that I'm all alone,
By the time I count from one to four,
I hear her on my door.
In the evening when the sun goes down,
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round,
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight.
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright.
That's why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
That's why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just, I love her so.
That's why I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
